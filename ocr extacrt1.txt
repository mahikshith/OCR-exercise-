words are very deficient, and with all the art & skill I
am mistress of, can not produce one sentence, that
will convey to you the least Idea of my family's distressing situation &
feelings. Such things are better felt than described.
I thought my affliction was beyond comparison
great, & incapable of increase, even by the presence
of the object, the sole cause of it. But here I
found myself deceived mistaken. The sight
of the object increased my affliction, and my
grief which had a little subsided, returned with
redoubled force. The afflictions sorrow of that
my uncle's family appeared as distressing as great or more so, &
Joined with other circumstances, the appearance
of the Corps, the solemnity of the funeral, the
procession to the meeting house, where an affecting
sermon was there delivered, suitable to the occasion;
the solemn procession from thence to the Grave,
where the last office was done performed, to the remains
of my dear departed brother in the and all in the
most decent, regular & orderly manner, the cheer
fulness willingness, & alacrity of those who assisted,
(which I thought reflected honor not only upon the
town

31/3/24 AI OCR Tools
Quite unusually for me, this essay started its life
as a scribble in a notebook rather than something
I typed into a markdown editor. A few weeks ago
Tiago Forte made a short video suggesting that
people can use GPT4-V to capture their hand-written
notes digitally. I've been looking for a "smart"
OCR tool that can process my terribly scratchy,
spidery hand writing for many years and none have
quite cut the mustard. But, I thought, why not
give it a go. To my absolute surprise, GPT did
a phenomenal job of parsing my scrawlings and
spitting out text. I was seriously impressed.
Handwriting OCR has now gone from a fun toy
and conversation piece to something I can actually, seriously
use in my workflow. So then, is GPT via ChatGPT
the best option I've got for this task or are
there any Foss tools and models that I could
use instead?
The Classic option: CRAFT-TRoCR
I played with this a couple of years ago and
it was reasonably good at certain content but only
if I write in my very best hand writing all the time.
And I don't do that because when I am taking
notes in a meeting or something, I am thinking about
the meeting, not my hand writing.
How does CRAFT-TRoCR work? Are there any major
differences? I'm guessing a big transformer model
is able to maximise probability globally across the
image + the generated text.

Today is Thursday, October 20th – But it
definitely feels like a Friday. I'm already
considering making a second cup of
coffee – and I haven't even finished my
first. Do I have a problem?
Sometimes I'll flip through older notes I've
taken, and my handwriting is unrecognizable.
Perhaps it depends on the type of pen I use?
I've tried writing in all caps BUT IT LOOKS SO
FORCED AND UNNATURAL.
Often times, I'll just take notes on my
laptop, but I still seem to gravitate toward
pen and paper. Any advice on what to
improve? I already feel stressed out looking
back at what I've just written – it looks like
3 different people wrote this!!

i'm feeling a renewed sense of optimism and purpose in the new year.
i suppose that it is to to be expected, but it makes it non the less a
real feeling. often i have gotten down on myself in the face of kinks
and jerks in the road, yet thankfully these habits seem to be
fading as my mindfullness practice continues. i have to chuckle at
just how helpful and insightful those little quotes are on my home
screen, waking up to a new bit of insight every day keeps them from
aging into cliché. this newfound calm and perspective has really helped
me work through these recent familial issues, perhaps most unexpectedly
in the expression of allowing me to be mindfull of my own actions and
shortcomings. ha! stop i have just remembered the study in which it
was shown that writing about an event that happened to you or an idea you
can help you better proccess and understand. what if there was some
way to be given daily prompts on different lenses to journal in, perhaps one
day its a gritty noir, the next its a rom-com. may be it could prompt
different characters in an internal family systems. or a sibling or friend
maybe from an eternal diety or a stranger on the street. i must share
this with josh and taya tout suite! it is also seven, i must conclude
this entry now and rejoin the world.
